/**
 * MySQL lexer.
 *
 * An exhaustive lexer for the MySQL SQL dialect with multi-version support.
 * It scans the provided SQL input payload and generates MySQL token objects.
 * The lexer is intended to cover 100% of the MySQL SQL syntax for all MySQL
 * versions starting from 5.7. It's likely to support older versions as well.
 *
 * The lexer is implemented with zero dependencies, it doesn't require any PHP
 * extensions, and it doesn't use PCRE or any other regular expression engines.
 *
 * This lexer is based on the MySQL Workbench lexer grammar.
 * See:
 *   https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench/blob/8.0.38/library/parsers/grammars/MySQLLexer.g4
 *   https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench/blob/8.0.38/library/parsers/grammars/predefined.tokens
